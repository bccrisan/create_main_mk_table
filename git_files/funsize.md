|21|Simon Fraser|Update funsize scheduler for public balrog api (#73)  This change will allow us to use the public balrog  API, that doesn't require credentials, and so remove  one dependent secret from the config.    It'll also be the same api that funsize uses when the  scheduler is rolled into the task graph generation.|[URL](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/funsize/commit/c763f3869ed6c484f0bcbe1015150a42c30e8f13)|2017-07-24 15:21:07

|2|Simon Fraser|bug 1334428, cope with nightly buildids that don't have all platforms. (#52)  Should also help with bug 1331707 and give the tasks more meaningful symbols in treeherder.    Since not every build has all platforms, we need to generate a list of relevant builds and  work on that, which means rearranging the internal loop.  Since submitting in the previous  place would then break the update_number, which makes it into the final MAR, move the  task submission out to the end, so we can generate the tasks in the proper order.    It means each Update-\d group in treeherder is for a particular 'from' generation, making  it hopefully easier to track what's going on.|[URL](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/funsize/commit/dbc6cf2eca65a8ffbea5f2a0c19444dad3298c8b)|2017-01-30 09:30:07
